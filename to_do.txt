- add sql code
- clean up gradient model code and integrate it into reopo
- run linear regression model for all zip codes and compare accuracy
- determine if the relationship between factors other than zip code influence price in the same way
    when looking at different zip codes, i.e., is there a way to look at the influence of these factors
    on price when controlling for zip code?
